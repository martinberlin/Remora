## midi to ORCA

The mission of this example is to show how to extract midi Notes and export them in a format readable by [ORCA](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/orca)

A working example is hosted here http://api.slosarek.eu/orca/index.php?mid=Nils_Frahm-Hammers.mid

The library we use is doing it's work im the fromtend and it's called
@tonejs/midi

## How to make it work

Just try to upload a .mid in the demo website or install it locally cloning this repo and doing in this directory:
**npm install**

to install the dependencies locally.

NOTE that PhP backend for this example is trivial and just used to upload a file in midi directory but all the midi to ORCA transformation happens in the frontend.

## To understand how it works just look at the /js directory

/js/midi-out.js main file that reads the midi object generated by Tonejs and outputs the note in different formats

It extracts Octave, Note and Velocity letting the user copy whatever he wants to ORCA grid.
Offers a simple silence detection and a manual every N Notes do this amount of silences and some export settings
Any change in one of the inputs or radio buttons triggers a new read and export keeping the track (mostly) of the midi. To trigger another track/instrument just click on the left panel.
