### Instructions to install 

Running:

npm install midi

I got an error about gyp==0.1 distribution was not found
I solved it using pyenv to switch my Python version to last 2.x version.

After this you can install that requirement using pip with following command:

pip install git+https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/gyp
